<p><b>Land Value Taxation (LVT):</b> Buy, sell and register land, and pay LVT into the application. In order for LVT to be implemented without permission from the state, communities would need to collectively buy the land, divide the land into plots, install the free-standing housing modules (below), and then rent them out to communty members.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Revenue from LVT, adverts and the lottery will be redistributed in the form of credits, which include: Social credits, Health Credits, and Education Credits.</p>
