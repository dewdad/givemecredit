<h3>Land Value Taxation (LVT)</h3>

<p>Users will be able to buy, sell and register land, and pay LVT into the application.</p>

<p>Given that this is just an application, and a decentralized one at that, obviously we cannot tax anyone. The LVT used in this application is not a tax in the traditional sense of the word. Below is an example of how the LVT will be levied:</p>
<ul class="docs-list">
    <li>Communities play the lottery</li>
    <li>Proceeds from the lottery get redistributed in the form of Social Credits.</li>
    <li>Social Credits are donated to the Land &amp; Housing public service.</li>
    <li>A member of the community will be elected to use this money to buy land, register it as community-owned land, break it into plots and establish a rental value for each plot.</li>
    <li>Users can then register a plot and pay LVT into the application.</li>
    <li>On these plots we can install free-standing, flat-pack, modular housing units - built using aluminium profile technology.</li>
    <li>Using the revenue from LVT/lottery/ads, we can buy more land and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, LVT can be used to replace our current system of taxation. For example, most people pay a lot of rent money to a private landlord. Using this system, the rent money goes back into the application in the form of a tax, thus negating the need to tax the product of someone labour - which is a violation of private property rights, and bad for the economy.</p>

<p>DSS (housing benefit) will be accepted. Again, when citizens receive housing benefit, the money usually goes to a private landlord. Using this system, the money goes back into the system, thus allowing for a more sustainable form of socialism. However, using this system, DSS will eventually become redundant.</p>
