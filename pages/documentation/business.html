<p><b>GiveMeCredit:</b> Submit ideas, vote on ideas, and receive Social Credits (and recognition) for your ideas. You can also contribute to other peoples ideas, and receive credit for your contributions. </p>

<p>GiveMeCredit provides an alternative to the current copyright/IP system. The problem with treating IP as private property is that all ideas are in some way or another derived from other peoples ideas. Yet, we expend energy developing theses ideas. As such, IP is a bit of a grey area. The way around this is to create a system whereby we can identify and determine the value of an individual's contribution. The IP system must be a universal system. As such, a browser extension would be more appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Crowdfunding:</b> Crowdfund your ideas or donate Social Credits to other peoples ideas. You can only crowdfund an idea that has a minimum of X votes and a minimum positive feedback score of 90%.</p>
<p><b>Business search &amp; registration:</b> When you register a business, a business profile will automatically be setup which displays a business representative, transparency score, social rating, consumer/employee reviews, and more. Each business will have an over-all score â€“ similar to the positive feedback score on ebay.</p>
<p><b>Employment:</b> Advertise jobs, search for employees, search and apply for jobs instantly without any charge.</p>
