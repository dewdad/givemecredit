<h3>Business &amp; Employment</h3>

<h4>GiveMeCredit</h4>
<p>Submit ideas, vote on ideas, and receive Social Credits (and recognition) for your ideas. You can also contribute to other peoples ideas, and receive credit for your contributions. </p>

<p>GiveMeCredit provides an alternative to the current copyright/IP system. The problem with treating IP as private property is that all ideas are in some way or another derived from other peoples ideas. Yet, we expend energy developing theses ideas. As such, IP is a bit of a grey area. The way around this is to create a system whereby we can identify and determine the value of an individual's contribution. The IP system must be a universal system. As such, a browser extension (or a feature built into the browser) would be more appropriate.</p>

<h4>Crowdfunding</h4>
<p>Crowdfund your ideas or donate Social Credits to other peoples ideas. You can only crowdfund an idea that has a minimum of X votes and a minimum positive feedback score of 90%.</p>

<h4>Business search &amp; registration</h4>
<p>When you register a business, a business profile will automatically be setup which displays a business representative, transparency score, social rating, consumer/employee reviews, and more. Each business will have an over-all score â€“ similar to the positive feedback score on ebay.</p>

<h4>Employment</h4>
<p>Here employers can advertise jobs for free and search for employees based on a sophisticated search function.</p>
<p>Likewise, employees can search and apply for jobs instantly without any charge.</p>

<h4>Marketing</h4>
<p>Given that all advertising revenue goes back into the application, it make sense to ensure that advertsare as relavent as possible. The more relavent they are, the more money there will be to finance public services. As such, users will be asked to fill out surveys. The data from these surveys will be available to the public. These surveys can also be used when someone wants to start a business. At the end of the day, someone, somewhere is going to try and sell their products and serices to you. If we try to make it hard for them to target us, what we end up with is either SPAM, or a situation where advertisers are scrapping our details without our knowledge.</p>

<h4>Mutual Credit System</h4>
<p>The MCS will use the Cyclos.org community banking software - used by a number of towns in the UK, for their own local currencies. However, to the best of my knowledge, these towns don't actually use the MCS that is baked into the software. A Mutual Credit System is a very simple system where users are given a credit score, and they can trade those credits with anyone else who uses the system. They provide a tried and tested way of stimulating the local economy.</p>

<h4>Prouct Search</h4>
<p>The only advantage of using this feature is that the application will enable easy payments through cryptocurencies. Again, we do not need to build a cusomized shopping application, we could just aggregate data from existing ones.</p>
