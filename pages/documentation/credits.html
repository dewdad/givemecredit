<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>Any time money gets paid into the application, either via the land value tax, lottery or advertisements, the money gets redistributed to all members in the same post/zip code. Money gets paid in to a Smart Contract. You can read about Smart Contracts in the technical section if you want. The Smart Contract will store these funds, and send back the credits. There are currently three types of credits you can receive:</p>

<p><b>Social Credits:</b> When you give your social credits to either a public service, idea or start-up, you get a tax rebate of 10%, which acts as an incentive for users to participate. At the end of each month, any unused Social Credits will be redistributed.

<p>
    <b>Health Credits:</b> These can be redeemed by registered private healthcare service providers, and will be used to compliment the NHS.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Education Credits: </b>These can be redeemed by sitting courses in the built-in education section. Education Credits can also be topped up in the Fund Public Services page.</p>
<p>
    These credits are encrypted and only the Smart Contract has the decryption key. Why? Because we need to make sure that users do not trade their credits, as this would defeat the purpose of the application. Below is an example of how the process works.
</p>
<p>
    Assuming the community has voted for a Mayor. The Mayor can now setup public services. When they setup a public service, it gets registered with the Smart Contract. The public service will be registered under the (crypto) address of whoever setup the service (they will need to enter their address when setting up the service). Initially, the Mayor will setup the service. However, as the application evolves, the community will start to elect new officials. When an official is elected, they are allowed to setup a service, and enter their own address in the input. Now, when a user donates their Social Credits to a public service, the funds go to the address associated with whoever setup the service.
