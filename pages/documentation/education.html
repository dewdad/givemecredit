<h3>Education system</h3>
<p>The system separates grade-based learning from other learning methods. </p>
<ul class="docs-list">
    <li>Courses are built using the “course builder”.</li>
    <li>Courses follow a deterministic pattern. Each section consists of a 2 minute video presentation followed by 3 multiple choice questions. There are 20 sections in a course. Students must score 100% in order to pass. If they fail, they will need to sit the course again.</li>
    <li>Students get paid for sitting courses. The amount they get paid depends on the level of the course and the rating.</li>
    <li>After you sit a course you are required to review the course.</li>
    <li>The level of the course depends on how valuable it is to society.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system also provides a notice board about lectures in your area.</p>
