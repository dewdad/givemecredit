<h3>Public Profile</h3>


<p>Each user will have a profile. Profile data will be stored by Inrupt in order to keep the data separate from the application. This allows you to keep control over your data and port it to a different platform if you want. Inrupt is being developed by Tim berners-lee - the inventor of the WWW.</p>

    When signing up for a Pod, you will need a WebID to verify your identify. I haven't yet decided the best way to do this yet. For example, WebID Solutions GmbH provide secure electronic identification of people via video call. WebID complies with and exceeds all data protection regulations and other requirements and laws (e.g. Money Laundering Act (GwG)). All you need is a mobile phone to receive a code via SMS, and a valid ID document.

<p>Each profile has a social rating, which is determined by how you interact with other members on the platform. Each profile has a voting weight, which is calculated based on your age, education score (from the built-in education system) and social rating.
