<h3>Public services</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="#/documentation/credits">Credits</a> section of the documentation, public services are financed by Social Credits. Below is a breif explaination of how they work.</p>

<h3>Social Credits</h3>
<p>
    Assuming the community has voted for a Mayor. The Mayor can now setup public services. When they setup a public service, it gets registered with the Smart Contract. The public service will be registered under the (crypto) address of whoever setup the service (they will need to enter their address when setting up the service). Initially, the Mayor will setup the service. However, as the application evolves, the community will start to elect new officials. When an official is elected, they are allowed to setup a service, and enter their own address in the input. Now, when a user donates their Social Credits to a public service, the funds go to the address associated with whoever setup the service.
